// GoalVerifier
//
// Task completion is not the same as goal completion. The scheduler tells us
// whether individual tasks executed and verified; the GoalVerifier decides
// whether the USER'S GOAL was actually achieved. It weighs multiple independent
// sources of evidence and JUSTIFIES its conclusion with that evidence:
//
//   - declared success criteria (intent.successCriteria)
//   - per-task verification outcomes (VERIFIED / PARTIALLY_VERIFIED / FAILED / …)
//   - the scheduler's terminal status (current state after any recovery/replan)
//   - observation evidence, including detected changes (expected mutations) and
//     changes that were NOT expected by any task (unexpected mutations)
//   - the semantic world-state snapshot
//   - explicit warnings (partial verifications, timeouts, recovered failures)
//
// It returns one of:
//   COMPLETED, COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS, PARTIALLY_COMPLETED, FAILED, INCONCLUSIVE
